# Penguin Prediction

This repository contains code to do the following:

1. Train a model to predict penguin species based on penguin dimensions
2. Offer the above model's predictions as an API.

## Deployment

The API is currently deployed on Heroku.

## Data source

The data used in this project is sourced from the [Palmer Penguins](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data) dataset.

## Rationale

This is not a very complex project or an example of best practice; it's intended as a teaching aide to demonstrate the core concepts of model use and API creation.
