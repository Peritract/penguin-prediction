# Penguin Prediction

This branch contains starter code for an API that predicts penguin species based on dimensions. The `notebooks/` folder contains the code to train a predictive model; the API itself should be built in `app.py`.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

`python app.py`

## Data source

The data used in this project is sourced from the [Palmer Penguins](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data) dataset.
